# 🔢 Sorting Algorithms in Java

This project demonstrates multiple classic **sorting algorithms** implemented in Java. It is designed for educational purposes and to help others understand the logic and performance of different sorting techniques.

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

- 🔁 Bubble Sort
- 📥 Insertion Sort
- 📤 Selection Sort
- 🧩 Merge Sort
- ⚡ Quick Sort

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java (Core)
- IDE: NetBeans or VS Code
- Simple console-based implementation

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the project in NetBeans or VS Code.
2. Compile all `.java` files.
3. Run the `Main` class to execute sorting functions.
4. You can modify the input arrays directly in code to test different cases.

## 💡 Purpose

- Improve understanding of how sorting algorithms work internally.
- Compare time and space complexity.
- Prepare for coding interviews and academic use.
